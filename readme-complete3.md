To implement Hyperledger Cacti SDK for data transfer between two Hyperledger Fabric networks, the following steps cover both configuring your Fabric networks and setting up Cacti SDK to relay data. The process involves installing and configuring Cacti connectors, setting up event listeners, and writing the logic to transfer data between networks.

Steps Overview

1. Set up Hyperledger Fabric Networks: Ensure you have two separate Fabric networks running.


2. Install Hyperledger Cacti: Install Cacti and set up connectors for both Fabric networks.


3. Configure Cacti SDK: Configure Cacti SDK to communicate with both networks.


4. Chaincode Modifications: Emit events in Network A and relay them to Network B.


5. Write Relay Logic: Use Cacti SDK to listen to events and relay data.


6. Test the Setup: Test the data transfer between the two networks.

Prerequisites

1. Two Hyperledger Fabric networks (Network A and Network B) are set up and running.


2. Docker installed to run the Fabric networks and Cacti.


3. Node.js and npm installed for running the Cacti SDK.


4. Connection profiles (networkA_connection_profile.json and networkB_connection_profile.json) are created for both networks.

Step 1: Set Up Hyperledger Fabric Networks

You need two Hyperledger Fabric networks (Network A and Network B). Each network must have its own peer, orderer, and chaincode deployed. Both networks should be accessible, and each should have a connection profile for Cacti to communicate with.

If you haven't set up the Fabric networks yet, follow the Hyperledger Fabric documentation for configuring a basic network.

Example of Starting Fabric Network A and Network B:

1. Start Network A:


```
cd fabric-samples/test-network
./network.sh up
./network.sh createChannel
./network.sh deployCC -ccn fabcar -ccp ../chaincode/fabcar/go/ -ccl go
```
2. Start Network B: Follow the same steps for Network B but make sure it's set up in a separate folder.

Step 2: Install Hyperledger Cacti

Hyperledger Cacti provides a set of connectors to communicate with different blockchain platforms. You will be using Fabric connectors to relay data between two Fabric networks.

2.1 Install Cacti

Clone the Hyperledger Cacti repository and install dependencies.
```
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/cacti.git
cd cacti
npm install
```

---

Step 3: Configure Cacti SDK for Fabric Networks

You will configure two Fabric ledger connectors within Cacti, one for each network.

3.1 Connector Configuration for Network A

Create a file named networkA-config.json:
```
{
  "pluginRegistry": [
    {
      "packageName": "@hyperledger/cacti-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric",
      "pluginInstanceId": "plugin-connector-fabric-networkA",
      "options": {
        "connectionProfile": "path/to/networkA_connection_profile.json",
        "username": "admin",
        "channelName": "mychannel",
        "chainCodeId": "fabcar",
        "organization": "Org1MSP",
        "logLevel": "debug"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
3.2 Connector Configuration for Network B

Create a file named networkB-config.json:
```
{
  "pluginRegistry": [
    {
      "packageName": "@hyperledger/cacti-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric",
      "pluginInstanceId": "plugin-connector-fabric-networkB",
      "options": {
        "connectionProfile": "path/to/networkB_connection_profile.json",
        "username": "admin",
        "channelName": "mychannel",
        "chainCodeId": "fabcar",
        "organization": "Org1MSP",
        "logLevel": "debug"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
3.3 Start the Cacti Server

Run the Cacti SDK server to initialize the connectors.
```
npm start
```

---

Step 4: Modify Chaincode to Emit Events

You need to modify the chaincode for Network A to emit events when certain transactions (like creating a car) occur. These events will be captured by Cacti and relayed to Network B.

Example Chaincode for Network A (Emitting Events)
```
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"strconv"

	"github.com/hyperledger/fabric-contract-api-go/contractapi"
)

type SmartContract struct {
	contractapi.Contract
}

type Car struct {
	Make   string `json:"make"`
	Model  string `json:"model"`
	Color  string `json:"color"`
	Owner  string `json:"owner"`
}

// Initialize the ledger with sample data
func (s *SmartContract) InitLedger(ctx contractapi.TransactionContextInterface) error {
	cars := []Car{
		{Make: "Toyota", Model: "Prius", Color: "blue", Owner: "Tomoko"},
		{Make: "Ford", Model: "Mustang", Color: "red", Owner: "Brad"},
	}

	for i, car := range cars {
		carAsBytes, _ := json.Marshal(car)
		err := ctx.GetStub().PutState("CAR"+strconv.Itoa(i), carAsBytes)
		if err != nil {
			return fmt.Errorf("Failed to put car in ledger: %v", err)
		}
	}
	return nil
}

// CreateCar adds a car to the ledger and emits an event
func (s *SmartContract) CreateCar(ctx contractapi.TransactionContextInterface, carID string, make string, model string, color string, owner string) error {
	car := Car{
		Make:  make,
		Model: model,
		Color: color,
		Owner: owner,
	}

	carAsBytes, _ := json.Marshal(car)
	err := ctx.GetStub().PutState(carID, carAsBytes)
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("Failed to add car to ledger: %v", err)
	}

	// Emit event for Cacti to pick up
	err = ctx.GetStub().SetEvent("CarCreated", carAsBytes)
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("Failed to emit event: %v", err)
	}

	return nil
}

func main() {
	chaincode, err := contractapi.NewChaincode(new(SmartContract))
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error creating chaincode: %s", err.Error())
		return
	}

	if err := chaincode.Start(); err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Error starting chaincode: %s", err.Error())
	}
}
```
This chaincode emits a CarCreated event that Cacti will capture and relay to Network B.


---

Step 5: Write Relay Logic Using Cacti SDK

Once the event is emitted from Network A, Cacti will listen for the event and relay the data to Network B.

Example Relay Script
```
const { PluginLedgerConnectorFabric } = require("@hyperledger/cacti-plugin-ledger-connector-fabric");

async function relayCarFromNetworkAtoNetworkB(networkAClient, networkBClient, carID) {
    try {
        // Query the car data from Network A
        const carData = await networkAClient.transact({
            contractName: 'fabcar',
            channelName: 'mychannel',
            methodName: 'QueryCar',
            args: [carID],
        });
        console.log(`Car data from Network A: ${JSON.stringify(carData)}`);

        // Relay the car data to Network B
        const relayResponse = await networkBClient.transact({
            contractName: 'fabcar',
            channelName: 'mychannel',
            methodName: 'RelayCar',
            args: [carID, JSON.stringify(carData)],
        });
        console.log(`Data successfully relayed to Network B: ${relayResponse}`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error relaying car data: ", error);
    }
}

// Event listener for Network A
networkAClient.on("CarCreated", async (event) => {
    console.log("CarCreated event detected from Network A", event);
    const carID = event.key;
    await relayCarFromNetworkAtoNetworkB(networkAClient, networkBClient, carID);
});
```
Explanation:

Event Listener: This listens for the CarCreated event from Network A.

Relay Logic: Upon receiving the event, the relay logic queries the car data from Network A and sends it to Network B.



---

Step 6: Test Data Transfer

1. Deploy Chaincode: Deploy the modified chaincode on Network A and Network B.


2. Start Cacti: Ensure Cacti is running and has access to both Fabric networks.


3. Trigger Events: On Network A, create a new car using the chaincode. The event should be captured by Cacti and relayed to Network B.


4. Verify: Use peer commands or query functions in Network B to verify the data has been transferred successfully.

Conclusion

By following these steps, you will have implemented Hyperledger Cacti SDK to relay data between two Hyperledger Fabric networks. The process involves setting up connectors for both networks, modifying the chaincode to emit events
